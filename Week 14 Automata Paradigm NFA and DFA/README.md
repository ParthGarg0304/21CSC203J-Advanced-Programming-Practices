In the context of formal language theory and automata theory, NFA (Non-deterministic Finite Automaton) and DFA (Deterministic Finite Automaton) are two types of finite state machines used to model and recognize regular languages.

Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA):

A DFA is a type of finite state machine where, for each state and input symbol, there is exactly one transition to a new state. The transition from one state to another is determined uniquely by the current state and the input symbol. DFAs are characterized by their deterministic nature, meaning that there is no ambiguity in the choice of the next state. They are relatively simple to understand and implement, making them useful for recognizing regular languages. In Python, you can implement a DFA using a transition table or a state-transition diagram.

Non-deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA):

In contrast to DFAs, NFAs allow for multiple possible transitions from a given state for a given input symbol. This non-deterministic behavior makes them more expressive but also potentially more complex. Python can be used to implement NFAs by representing transitions as sets of possible next states.

In summary, both DFA and NFA are models of computation used in automata theory to recognize regular languages. While DFAs are deterministic and have unique transitions for each state and input symbol, NFAs allow for non-deterministic transitions, providing greater expressive power. Python can be used effectively to implement both types of finite automata for various applications, including lexical analysis in compilers and pattern matching in text processing.
